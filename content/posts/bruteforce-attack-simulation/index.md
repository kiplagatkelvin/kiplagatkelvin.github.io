### Introduction 

This report summarizes the results of a brute-force attack simulation
using John the Ripper, outlines the defensive measures applied, and
explains the importance of strong passwords and encryption in preventing
such attacks. The aim of the exercise was to better understand the
vulnerabilities associated with weak password protection and how
attackers exploit these weaknesses using brute-force methods.
Screenshots of the process are attached as evidence of the attack and
defense phases.

**Brute-Force Attack Simulation**

**Step 1: Creating the myfile.txt File**

I first created a simple text file named myfile.txt that would be used
to demonstrate the process of password-protecting a zip file and
subsequently performing a brute-force attack using John the Ripper.

I had to create myfile.txt before zipping and password-protecting it,
you can follow these steps:

*Cat \> myfile.txt*

data-width="975" data-height="142" />

</figure>

**Step 2: Creating a Password-Protected Zip File**

Next, I created a password-protected zip file named test.zip that
contains the myfile.txt file. The zip file was encrypted with the
password 123456.

*zip -e test.zip myfile.txt*

<figure id="ac4a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">

data-width="975" data-height="368" />
<figcaption>output 2</figcaption>
</figure>

You will be prompted to enter and verify a password for the zip file.
The password used for this demonstration was 123456.Below screenshot

data-width="975" data-height="101" />

</figure>

**Step 3: Attempting to Brute-Force the Zip File's Password Using John
the Ripper**

To crack the password, I needed to perform a brute-force attack using
John the Ripper. However, John the Ripper requires the password hash of
the file to be extracted before attempting to crack it.

**Step 4: Extracting the Password Hash Using zip2john**

John the Ripper uses the zip2john utility to extract the password hash
from the zip file. We used the following command to extract the hash of
test.zip and store it in a file named hash.txt.

*zip2john test.zip \> hash.txt*

<figure id="3797" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*u92WUGLkQygRnq6KN35OqQ.png"

data-width="1067" data-height="111" />
<figcaption>output 4</figcaption>
</figure>

The output from zip2john gives you detailed information about the
encrypted zip file and the file contained within it, which helps in
identifying the specifics of the encryption and compression used. This
is useful for understanding the context of the password-cracking process
you're engaged in with John the Ripper.

**Step 5: Cracking the Password Using John the Ripper**

Now that we have the password hash, we used John the Ripper to perform a
brute-force attack on the zip file using the popular *rockyou.txt
wordlist.*

The password used to protect the file was intentionally weak
(password123456), which allowed for easy brute-forcing. *The
password.lst* wordlist was used to simulate the brute-force attack. The
attack was executed using the following John the Ripper command:

*john --- wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt*

<figure id="5fad" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ODkxVCWtWIQFaBnIIiZ0QQ.png"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ODkxVCWtWIQFaBnIIiZ0QQ.png"
data-width="975" data-height="207" />
<figcaption>output 5</figcaption>
</figure>

**Results**: John the Ripper successfully identified the weak password
password123456 from the wordlist in a matter of seconds. This highlights
how vulnerable files protected by weak passwords are to brute-force
attacks, which can easily guess commonly used passwords. Below is a
summary of the attack process:

-   **Zip file created**: A text file, myfile.txt, was zipped and
    protected with a weak password.
-   **Brute-force attack**: Using John the Ripper and the password.lst
    wordlist, the zip file's password was cracked successfully.
-   **Time taken**: The password cracking was nearly instantaneous due
    to the weak nature of the password.

**Documenting the Process of Strengthening Password Protection**

**Step 1: Create a New Password-Protected File with Stronger
Encryption**

To enhance the security of the password-protected file, we will create a
new zip file (test_strong.zip) with a complex password.

**1.** **Create the File:** First, ensure you have the myfile.txt file
prepared. Since we already have *myfile.txt .*I had created the the file
earlier on. just lets confirm if the file still exist using :

***ls -****alp*

<figure id="e9c0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AkaEbSQn4z_M_rl_2sE0lA.png"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*AkaEbSQn4z_M_rl_2sE0lA.png"
data-width="975" data-height="348" />
<figcaption>output 6</figcaption>
</figure>

**2. Zip the File with Stronger Password:** Use a complex password that
includes special characters, numbers, and both uppercase and lowercase
letters. In this case, we'll use A8b\$92Gk!

*zip -e test_strong.zip myfile.txt*

-   **When prompted, enter the complex password:**

<figure id="2622" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*S72LLkkLwc9r24ysuMXhSQ.png"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*S72LLkkLwc9r24ysuMXhSQ.png"
data-width="975" data-height="64" />
<figcaption>output 7</figcaption>
</figure>

Enter password: A8b\$92Gk!

Verify password: A8b\$92Gk!

**Step 2: Verify Encryption**

Now, use zip2john to verify the encryption method of the new zip file:

*zip2john test_strong.zip \> hash_strong.txt*

<figure id="8ed4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-ixS0o66ycurUyd127oqNA.png"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*-ixS0o66ycurUyd127oqNA.png"
data-width="975" data-height="40" />
<figcaption>output 8</figcaption>
</figure>

Above image indicates that I have successfully generated the hash for
the new password-protected zip file test_strong.zip using zip2johncat
hash_strong.txt

So, we can see what we have in the *hash_strong.txt* in the below image
**Breakdown of hash_strong.txt**

<figure id="5566" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eaud4FlMmb30gbqrC3SmPQ.png"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*eaud4FlMmb30gbqrC3SmPQ.png"
data-width="975" data-height="45" />
<figcaption>output 9</figcaption>
</figure>

**Format**: The string begins with test_strong.zip/myfile.txt: which
indicates the zip file and the specific file inside it that is password
protected.

**Encryption Hash**:

-   [\$pkzip\$1\*2\*2\*0\*3\*f33\*b640f3df\*0\*44\*0\*3f\*1059\*fc237082bb09466bb77a05eb6e10e6d40af1b4d1a9c5e92aabafc0eab15bba43cf8d5cd88bd633e8fa6abefdcada8cd80dbdf057bfc0b74bd1383b8830c\*\$]{#cf95}

This is the hash generated from the password used to encrypt the file.
It contains several components that describe the encryption used.

**Step 3: Crack the New Password with John the Ripper**

Use John the Ripper to see if the new complex password can be cracked
using *the RockYou wordlist:*

*john --- wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_strong.txt*

<figure id="5bbd" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EIYY1i1_lIoudyAklcWDXw.png"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*EIYY1i1_lIoudyAklcWDXw.png"
data-width="1671" data-height="145" />
<figcaption>output 10</figcaption>
</figure>

Output:

-   0g 0:00:00:02 DONE (2024--10--09 04:00) 0g/s 6077Kp/s 6077Kc/s
    6077KC/s "2parrow"..\*7¡Vamos!

Observations:

-   The use of a strong password significantly increased the resistance
    to brute-force attacks.
-   The password might contain special characters or be of sufficient
    length, making it difficult for the wordlist to guess.

Results:

1.  Expected Outcome: Given that the password is complex, the cracking
    process may take significantly longer or may not succeed at
    all.
2.  Observation: Monitor the process to determine if John the Ripper is
    able to crack the password.

**Documenting the Results**

**Original Password:**

-   **Password:** 123456
-   **Time Taken to Crack:** Almost instantly (as shown in previous
    outputs).

**New Password:**

-   **Password:** A8b\$92Gk!
-   **Crack Attempt Outcome:** (e.g., John may report it cannot crack
    the password within a reasonable time).

**Step 4: Explanation of Why Strong Passwords and Encryption are
Necessary**

**1. Resistance to Brute-Force Attacks:**

-   Strong passwords are typically longer, more complex, and contain a
    mix of characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols). This
    makes brute-force attacks (where all possible combinations are
    attempted) significantly more time-consuming and difficult to
    succeed.

**2. Enhanced Security:**

-   By using stronger encryption methods (such as AES instead of
    PKZIP), the data itself is more secure against unauthorized access.
    Even if a password is compromised, the encryption adds another layer
    of defense.

**3. Importance of Regularly Updating Passwords:**

-   Regularly changing passwords to stronger alternatives can prevent
    long-term vulnerabilities. As computing power increases, even
    passwords that were once considered strong can become weak.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, transitioning from a weak password like 123456 to a
complex password such as A8b\$92Gk! significantly enhances the security
of password-protected files. This process illustrates the importance of
using strong passwords and encryption methods to mitigate risks
associated with unauthorized access and brute-force attacks.

**Defensive Measures**

After successfully simulating the brute-force attack, defensive measures
were implemented to protect against such vulnerabilities. Two primary
defensive strategies were applied:

1.  **Using a Strong Password**: A stronger password (A8b\$92Gk!) was
    used to re-protect the zip file. The new password was much longer
    and contained a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and
    special characters, increasing the complexity and making brute-force
    attacks significantly harder. This time, when John the Ripper was
    run again using the same wordlist (password.lst), it failed to crack
    the password, showing the effectiveness of a complex password in
    defending against brute-force attacks.
2.  **Using a Stronger Encryption Algorithm**: The encryption method
    was upgraded to AES-256, a widely regarded secure encryption
    algorithm. This ensured that even if an attacker could guess the
    password, they would still have to deal with a highly secure
    encryption algorithm, further protecting the file from unauthorized
    access.

**Importance of Strong Passwords and Encryption**

The brute-force attack demonstrated how easily a weak password like
password123 can be compromised. This underscores the importance of using
strong passwords and proper encryption to safeguard sensitive data.
There are several reasons why strong passwords and encryption are
essential:

1.  **Protection Against Brute-Force Attacks**: Weak passwords are
    vulnerable to brute-force attacks, where automated tools like John
    the Ripper try every possible password combination until the correct
    one is found. Longer passwords with a combination of letters,
    numbers, and special characters exponentially increase the number of
    possible combinations, making brute-force attacks far less
    effective.
2.  **Defense Against Dictionary Attacks**: Attackers often use
    pre-compiled wordlists (like rockyou.txt or password.lst), which
    contain millions of common passwords. A strong password that does
    not appear in these lists can prevent attackers from cracking it
    quickly. Moreover, such attacks are rendered ineffective when
    encryption is also employed alongside strong passwords.]{#bc83}
3.  **Encryption as an Extra Layer of Security**: Even if an attacker
    manages to crack a password, strong encryption ensures that the data
    remains protected. Modern encryption algorithms like AES-256 are
    mathematically complex and require significant computational power
    to break, adding an extra layer of security to sensitive
    files.
4.  **Compliance and Security Standards**: Many industries are required
    to use strong encryption and password policies to meet regulatory
    compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. Failure to
    implement these best practices not only increases vulnerability to
    attacks but can also lead to legal penalties.

**Conclusion**

The brute-force attack simulation clearly demonstrated the dangers of
weak passwords and the ease with which they can be cracked using freely
available tools like John the Ripper. By applying defensive measures
such as stronger passwords and advanced encryption algorithms, we
significantly improved the security of our protected files. This
exercise highlights the critical role of password strength and
encryption in protecting against brute-force attacks and ensuring the
integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data.
